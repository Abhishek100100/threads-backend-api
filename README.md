# Threads Backend API

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I built this project to learn and demonstrate real-world backend engineering using **Spring Boot** and **PostgreSQL**. This API powers a Threads-style social network, where users can post, comment, like, and follow each otherâ€”just like on Twitter or Instagram.

I wanted to make something thatâ€™s not only functional, but also easy for anyone to run, test, and extend. Thatâ€™s why itâ€™s fully dockerized, seeded with demo data, and comes with interactive API docs out of the box.

##  Features

- **User Management:** Register, update, and delete users.
- **Posts:** Create, read, update, and delete posts linked to users.
- **Comments:** Comment on posts, with full user and post linkage.
- **Likes:** Like posts (with user and post relationships).
- **Follows:** Follow/unfollow other users.
- **Robust Data Integrity:** All relationships are enforced by foreign keys and NOT NULL constraints.
- **Seeder:** Automatic database seeding with demo data.
- **Ready-to-import Postman Collection:** For instant API testing.
- **Interactive API Docs:** Built-in Swagger/OpenAPI UI.

- **Java 17**
- **Spring Boot 3**
- **Spring Data JPA**
- **PostgreSQL**
- **Maven**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- **Postman** (for API testing)
- **Swagger/OpenAPI** (for live docs)

##  Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Abhishek100100/threads-backend-api.git
cd threads-backend-api
```

### 2. Run with Docker (Recommended)

You can run the entire backend and PostgreSQL database with one command using Docker Compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

- This will start both the backend and the database.
- The API will be available at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
- Swagger docs will be at [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html).

To stop everything:
```bash
docker-compose down
```

> **Note:** Make sure Docker Desktop is running before you use these commands.

### 3. (Alternative) Run Locally Without Docker

- Make sure PostgreSQL is running and you have created the database and user (see below).
- Update `src/main/resources/application.properties` with your DB credentials.
- Build and run:

```bash
mvn clean package
java -jar target/threads-api-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

## Database Setup (If Not Using Docker)

If you want to set up the database manually:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE threads;
CREATE USER threadsuser WITH PASSWORD 'threadspass';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE threads TO threadsuser;
```

Update your `application.properties`:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/threads
spring.datasource.username=threadsuser
spring.datasource.password=threadspass
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```

## API Documentation (Swagger UI)

After starting the app, visit [http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html)  
Youâ€™ll find interactive, auto-generated documentation for all API endpoints.

## API Testing

- Import the provided Postman collection (`threads-api-final.postman_collection.json`) into Postman.
- All endpoints are ready to test, with sample bodies for each entity.
- Make sure to use valid IDs for relationships (e.g., `user: { "id": 2 }`).

## Data Seeding

- On first run, the app seeds the database with demo users, posts, comments, likes, and follows.
- Seeder logic is idempotent: no duplicate data on restart.

##  Database Schema

- All tables (`users`, `posts`, `comments`, `likes`, `follows`) are fully normalized.
- Foreign key constraints and NOT NULL rules prevent orphaned or invalid data.
- Timestamps (`created_at`) are set automatically in the backend.


## To Do

- Add JWT-based authentication and authorization
- Pagination and filtering for large datasets
- User profile endpoints and avatars
- Notification system for likes/comments/follows
- Frontend integration (React, Vue, etc.)
